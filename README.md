Welcome to the electronics repo for Project QUBO.
QUBO is an autonomous underwater vehicle and all of its electronics designs are stored here.

We use EAGLE for our circuit CAD.

eagleLibraries stores all the eagle libraries.

eagleDesigns sores all the boards that we design. Any design in this folder should ONLY USE COMPONENTS FROM THE eagleLibraries FOLDER.
